# Detecting Pneumonia from Chest X-Rays

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames air sacs in one or both lungs. Symptoms of pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening, therefore it is important to be able to diagnose this disease before it worsens. This project thus aims to construct a stable and accurate automatic detection model of pneumonia using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in Tensorflow.


Sample chest x-rays with pneumonia:

# Detecting Pneumonia from Chest X-Rays

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames air sacs in one or both lungs. Symptoms of pneumonia can range from mild to life-threatening, therefore it is important to be able to diagnose this disease before it worsens. This project thus aims to construct a stable and accurate automatic detection model of pneumonia using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in Tensorflow.
